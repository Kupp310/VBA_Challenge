# VBA_Challenge
Module2 Challenge
used the code from the class challenge "Stu-CreditCardChecker-Cell Comparison" as starting point.
Tried to use the code from the "Census" Class Challenge but I coulnd't get my code to go through all the worksheets.
I also coulnd't figure out any of the other code even after asking the the BCS Learning assistans and the previous class examples.
I've decided to get started on next weeks material so I can understand the class material better.
